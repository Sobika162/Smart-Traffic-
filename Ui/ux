Moodify is a clean, responsive UI for a mood-based music player app. The interface allows users to select their mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, Energetic, Calm) and receive playlist suggestions accordingly. The project focuses purely on frontend design—no backend or API integration—making it ideal for beginners. It features animated buttons, color-changing backgrounds based on mood, and a modern card layout for playlists. Moodify demonstrates essential UI/UX concepts like user interaction feedback, responsive layout, smooth transitions, and color psychology in design.
